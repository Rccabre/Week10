		For the fourth time in ten seasons, FC Barcelona were the team celebrating at the end of the UEFA Champions League final having claimed their fifth title overall in 2014/15 and made Juventus the first side to lose six European Cup deciders.</br>

Champions of Europe for the first time in 1992, Barcelona joined FC Bayern München and Liverpool FC on five titles with a 3-1 success over Juventus at Berlin's Olympiastadion. Goals from Ivan Rakitić and – after Álvaro Morata had equalised – Luis Suárez and Neymar secured a victory that gave Barcelona their second treble of Liga, Copa del Rey and UEFA Champions League as coach Luis Enrique followed Josep Guardiola in winning all three trophies in his first term in charge.</br>

Barça's journey to Berlin began slowly as a narrow home win against APOEL FC preceded a defeat at Paris Saint-Germain, but that loss was the catalyst for a run of nine straight victories, one shy of the competition record. The sequence included three successes against Paris, one on matchday six and two in the quarter-finals, and, for the second campaign running, two against Manchester City FC in the round of 16.</br>

Guardiola returned with his Bayern team for the semi-final but unanswered goals in the last 13 minutes at the Camp Nou from Lionel Messi (2) and Neymar effectively settled the tie, despite the Blaugrana's 3-2 second-leg reverse in Munich.

Barcelona's Berlin opponents were a Juve side making their first final appearance since 2003 and also seeking a treble having added a first Coppa Italia since 1995 to their fourth consecutive Serie A triumph. Massimiliano Allegri's men ousted Borussia Dortmund, AS Monaco FC and holders Real Madrid CF en route to Berlin – Morata getting the decisive semi-final goal against the team he left for Turin the previous summer – yet Barcelona proved a bridge too far. Thus 2015 joined 1973, 1983, 1997, 1998 and 2003 in the list of Juve's final disappointments.</br>

Madrid were irresistible in the autumn, winning all six group games – only the sixth time that had been achieved – and equalling Bayern's competition record with a tenth straight success at FC Schalke 04 in the round of 16 first leg. While a 4-3 home defeat in the return did not stop Carlo Ancelotti's troops progressing, they won just one of their four matches thereafter, edging past 2014 runners-up Club Atlético de Madrid in the last eight before losing 3-2 on aggregate to Juventus.</br>

There was also semi-final heartache for Bayern, who put seven goals past both AS Roma on matchday three and FC Shakhtar Donetsk in the round of 16 second leg, and overturned a 3-1 quarter-final first-leg deficit against FC Porto with a 6-1 stroll in Munich; they came up short against Barcelona. Paris knocked out Chelsea FC in the round of 16 thanks to an epic second-leg effort with ten men, yet fell in the quarter-finals for the third year in a row, while Arsenal FC suffered a fourth straight last-16 exit and Manchester City's elimination by Barcelona at the same stage meant, for the second time in three years, no English representatives in the last eight.  </br>   

Group phase highlights also included Shakhtar's Luiz Adriano scoring eight against FC BATE Borisov, Francesco Totti becoming the competition's oldest marksman and Xavi Hernández overtaking Raúl González as its leading appearance maker. The Barça midfielder then beat Madrid's Iker Casillas to be the first to 150 games in the semi-final second leg, and the Berlin finale was a fitting end to his Azulgrana career as he and his team-mates celebrated with the trophy once again.</br>
